# Chapter 0: Malware Analysis Primer
## Learning Points
* Goals of Malware Analysis
  * What does the malware do?
  * Develop signatures to identify in future
    * Host-based signature - detect on infected machines
    * Network-based signature - detect by analysing network traffic
  * How does it work?
  * What does it exploit? 
* Malware Analysis Techniques
  * Basic Static Analysis
    * Analyse without running the executable
    * Analyse without looking at the code
    * Quick to perform
    * Can be ineffective against complex malware
  * Basic Dynamic Analysis
    * Analyse with a running executable
    * Analyse without looking at code
    * Ensure to use a safe environment (VM)
    * May not be effective against some complex malware
  * Advanced Static Analysis
    * Analysis without running the executable
    * View the code in a disassembler and work out what it does
    * Requires knowledge of assembly language programming
  * Advanced Dynamic Analysis
    * Analysis with a running executable
    * Watch the code execute (e.g. in a debugger)
    * Enables you to see things that happen while the program runs which may not be obvious from Advanced Static Analysis
* Types of Malware
  * *Backdoor*: gives access to an attacker
  * *Botnet*: gives access to an attacker, but all infected computers receive the same instructions 
  * *Downloader*: just downloads other malicious code
  * *Information-stealing Malware*: collects information from infected computer and sends to attacker (e.g. keylogger)
  * *Launcher*: launches other malware programs - useful for stealth
  * *Rootkit*: helps make other malicious code difficult to detect - gives continued access to a computer while hiding its presence
  * *Scareware*: frightens the victim into buying security software by suggesting (falsely) their computer is infected with something more malicious than the scareware
  * *Spam-sending Malware*: uses the victims machine to send spam
  * *Worm or Virus*: can copy itself to infect other computers
* General Rules for Malware Analysis
  * Don't get caught up in details - concentrate on key features
  * Use different tools for different jobs
  * If one tool isn't finding something, try another tool that does the same job
  * Must be able to recognise, understand and defeat malware techniques and respond to changes and new techniques.
